## About

This was created in the month of Genuary (a month where a different generative art prompt was given each day), and I started working on day 18 (Definitely Not A Grid) early, and liked the project so much I decided I'd make this one mintable for the duration of the day.

This one is a little different to normal, and is a throw back to a years old photography project, I thought it'd be fun. This project is marked as image composition because, well, I'm making compositions of images, but probably not your normal composition.
